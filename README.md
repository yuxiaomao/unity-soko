# Implemented features
- Gameplay
  - Support multiples player objects in level
  - Reset level with `R`, undo level with `Z`
- Menu
  - Main menu
  - Pause menu
  - Level select menu: automatically generated based on `LevelManager.Level` and game progress
  - Buttons generated by script based on info instead of directly in inspector (voluntary to facilitate adaptation)
  - Button navigation with mouse/keyboard, automatic remove/add select for keyboard navigation
- Audio: Music and sound effets
- Localization: with Unity Localization package
  - Supported locale: English (`en`), Simplified Chinese (`zh-Hans`, with font `SourceHanSans`)
  - Supported UI element:
    - Text TMPro (with prefab `UILocalizedTextTMP` set entry with script or in inspector)
    - Dropdown TMPro (with prefab `UILocalizedDropdown`)
- Editor
  - Level: store/load level data from/to scene with custom editor button (`LevelManager`)
    - Note: To add a level in game, you'll need `Assets/Levels/Level[N].json` (can be generated by `LevelManager` in Unity editor) and add the level in c# enum `LevelManager.Level`.
- Internal implementation
  - Object: each object (player, box, target, ...) works independently, and does not know the global state of the game (voluntary to make difference with the pico-8 version)
  - User input: with Unity Input System package
  - Scenes: menu and levels are in separate Unity scenes (voluntary to experiment cross-scene functionalities)
  - Dynamic asset load from script: with Unity Addressable package
